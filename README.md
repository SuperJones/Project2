# Project 2
First foray into building a full-stack application from the ground up.

Objective: Build a game that motivates people to take more steps with steps tracker.

Idea: A user starts off with a basic weapon and duals other users. In order to make their weapons better, and have a better chance of winning in a dual, they must purchase upgrades. Money, for upgrades, is earned by getting steps with your steps tracker (like a Fitbit or Jawbone). The more steps you have, the more money you have to spend on upgrades.
